# PeytoIR
The script for the analysis of the TIR imagery on the debris-covered glacial ice at Peyto Glacier. 

The script folder contains the matlab scripts to :
1- register the .asc images to correct for camera movement and register a visual image to the TIR images (AXX scripts)
2- calculate the debris thickness across the study slope based on the measured debris thickness, and extract the TIR surface temperaure at these locations (BXX script and YXX script)
3- process and display the MET data during the experiment (X script)
4- analyse the empirical relationship between surface temperature and debris thickness (CXX, DXX and EXX script)

The TIR images, both raw and registered, are available at:
The Peyto AWS data is available at:, and related to: https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/13/2875/2021/essd-13-2875-2021.html
